# Privacy Policy for Image to PDF

**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025

## Introduction

Image to PDF ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application that allows users to convert images into PDF documents. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data and what permissions our app requires.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Collect

**Images and Photos:**
- We access photos and images from your device's gallery ONLY when you explicitly select them for PDF conversion
- Images are processed locally on your device and are NOT transmitted to any external servers
- We do not collect, store, or transmit your images to third parties

**PDF Files:**
- Generated PDF files are stored locally on your device in the app's private directory
- PDF files are created using the images you select and are not shared with us or any third parties

**No Personal Information:**
- We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location
- We do not use analytics or tracking services
- We do not display advertisements

### How We Use Your Data

- **Gallery Access:** Used only to let you select images for conversion to PDF
- **File System Access:** Used only to save generated PDF files locally on your device and allow you to share them
- **Storage Permissions:** Required to read selected images and write generated PDF files

### Data Storage and Security

- All data processing happens locally on your device
- Images and PDFs are stored only on your device's local storage
- We do not have access to your images, PDFs, or any other personal data
- You can delete the app at any time, which will remove all app data from your device

## Permissions Explained

Our app requires the following permissions for core functionality:

### 1. Storage/Media Permissions

**Android Permissions:**
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Allows the app to read images you select from your gallery
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Allows the app to save generated PDF files to your device

**How it's used:**
- These permissions are used ONLY to let you select images from your gallery and save PDFs you create
- We do not access any files outside of what you explicitly select
- We do not modify or delete any of your existing files

### 2. Photo Library Access (iOS)

- Used only to let you select images from your photo library for PDF conversion
- We do not access your entire photo library without your explicit permission

### Why We Need These Permissions

Without these permissions, the core functionality of the app would not work:
- You would not be able to select images from your gallery
- You would not be able to save generated PDF files
